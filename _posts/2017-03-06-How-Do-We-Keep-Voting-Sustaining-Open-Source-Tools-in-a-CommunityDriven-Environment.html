title: How Do We Keep Voting?&#58; Sustaining Open Source Tools in a Community-Driven Environment: Strategies
---
<p>In recent years, Code4Lib’s growth as a vital, evolving Open Source community has begun to highlight a common issue in software deployment and service management: what happens when the growth of users outpaces the ability to update or maintain software that serve as integral tools to the community, like our conference voting service?


We are just one of many communities facing this problem.  In this pre-conference, we seek to re-examine the model for developing and maintaining open source tools in a community-driven environment and address the problem of how to continue to provide services in a sustainable way.  Current workflows based on aging, increasingly inflexible software that is carried on the backs of one or two individuals with no institutional buy-in to continue support is not sustainable or fair to expect. 

This preconference will focus on the big picture, detailing the new role that software plays in providing services to an organization or community. We will develop sustainable strategies for implementing software and building a blueprint for using open source tools to meet software-addressable needs, examining and considering the need fulfilled rather than the software used.  

Attendees will come away with:
New perspectives on software’s role in a service-based organizational ecosystem
Strategies for building team models needed to sustainably support software in a community or organization
Methods for identifying healthy Open Source projects and programming languages to develop a sustainable infrastructure

Sustainable software is developed at many levels beyond the code itself.  For this workshop, we seek the input and collaboration of everyone in the Code4Lib community -- service and project managers, developers, and most of all, users.</p>
